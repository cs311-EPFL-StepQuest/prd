# Overview

In our current day and age, people's lives are becoming more and more sedentary. From that observation, we developed StepQuest, a fun, interactive way to encourage people to take on a healthier lifestyle through a variety of challenges and social features.

StepQuest is a free mobile application aiming to provide users with a way to make exercise more accessible and motivating through the idea of gamification. It features a basic step counter, a friend system, as well as several features interacting with the user's step count and position. Those include:

- daily and weekly step goals;
- a map and the option to create and follow routes;
- various challenges users can compete in with friends.

Moreover, all of these features are connected to a score system: when a user completes a step goal, a challenge or a route, they receive points; the application also displays global and friend leaderboards to further encourage them to go for higher goals and be more active.
