All around the world, people, especially younger generations, have been getting more sedentary for the past few decades. We live in an era where a short attention span is the norm and where most brains are programmed to seek short-term gratification over long-term benefits. Some products have already tried to create forms of exercise fitting for the 21st century; nevertheless, they are for the most part seen as novelty items and quickly fall into oblivion without truly being able to change the way people see physical activity.
