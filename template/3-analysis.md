# Analysis of the Situation

Multiple similar applications are available; namely, all kinds of step counters. Furthermore, several mobile apps/games implement step count and localization as part of their gameplay features, although most end up being short-lived phenomena rather than long-time life partners.

StepQuest is a fairly independent application and doesn't require any separate products in order to offer a complete user experience. However, considering that it features a social system, using a separate messaging service is recommended, as it provides users with a way of communicating with their in-game friends.
