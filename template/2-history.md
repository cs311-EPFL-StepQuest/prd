# History


The proof-of-concept we built has all the features described in the overview, as well as an authentication system and an offline mode. Its features are all functional, successfully demonstrating the purpose of the app.

Although the PoC's implementation is pretty much complete, its bare-bones nature might prevent it from being viable as a standalone application. For example, challenges aren't customizable and the feature to search for pre-existing routes appears somewhat rough around the edges. An overhaul of the application to make its UI easier to navigate and more uniform may be suitable for the MVP.
