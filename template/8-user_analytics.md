# User Analytics and Acceptance

<!-- *Goal: understand how users are using the app.*

*Which are the key metrics?*

*What is the success criteria?*

*What is the analysis plan (link to data collection)?*

*Include relevant A/B testing ideas.* -->

Analyzing the user experience is a crucial step before launching the MVP. User analytics help identify bugs and provide a deeper understanding of user requirements, enabling us to improve our product and achieve our business goals.

## Key metrics

Active users: daily active users, monthly active users, retention rate, regoin based user rate

User engagements: session duration, frequency of using the app, time in app, engagement rate for each function (e.g., step counter, route creation, following routes, social interactions with friends)

Acquisition metrcis: number of first-time users and the source of acquisition

Conversion rate: from app download to full usage of app functions

Perfromance metrcis: crash report, load time, error rates


## Success Criteria

1. High active users - achieving 20% for DAU/MAU, and 70% returning rate
2. High engagement rate - average session durations of at least 5 minutes with users engaging 3 times per week
3. Strong user acquisition - consistent growth in the number of first-time users
4. Robust conversion rate - 50% of users progressing from app download to regular user of core functions
5. Good performance - low crash rate, error rates and loading time.

## User Analytics

1. Utilize Google Analytics to understand user behavior, monitor which regions have the highest activity and engagement, and identify the most frequently used functions.
2. Monitor app performance using Firebase Crashlytics to track and address crashes and errors.

## A/B Testing Ideas

1. Test different processes for following routes and creating routes to identify the most intuitive experience for users.
2. Experiment with various formats for the challenge system to determine which one or combination drives the highest user engagement.
