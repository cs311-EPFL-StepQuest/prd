For monetization, We can apply different model of monetization but need to be very careful about how we introduce them in the app environement

We can base our app on a Freemium Model with basic features available for free to attract a wide user base and offer a subscription plan that provides access to advanced features, such as customizable challenges, advanced analytics, and exclusive content.
This approach can lead to a wide range of users by offering essential features for free but will have a small percentage of free users that may convert to paid subscriptions. And finding the balance between a generous free plan and a compelling premium plan can get very challenging.

In a second case we can propose In-App Purchases which allows users to purchase items or upgrades as needed, providing a steady revenue stream. This can also have a balancing issue with the game if we for example give items to increase points in the leaderboards.

Lastly, we can rely on partnerships and collaborations which gives brand exposure and could bring mutual benefits with the parteners. However the needs to reach a certain growth before having enough power in negotations and maintaining partnerships can be complex and time-consuming. The revenues can also be inconsistant.

Our best option is to start with a Freemium model, offering essential features for free while providing a compelling subscription plan for advanced features. This will help us attract a wide user base and create upsell opportunities. Additionally, we can introduce small-effect In-App Purchases that do not disrupt the game balance but offer value to users.

As the user base grows, we can leverage our increased negotiating power to establish partnerships and collaborations. These partnerships can help us reduce prices for in-app purchases and subscriptions, thereby maintaining a positive revenue growth trajectory over time.

By carefully balancing these monetization strategies, we aim to ensure a sustainable revenue model while delivering a valuable and engaging user experience.
